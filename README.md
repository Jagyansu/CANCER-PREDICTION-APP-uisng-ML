# Cancer Prediction App 🩺

This is a **Cancer Prediction App** built with Python and Streamlit — designed to predict the likelihood of cancer based on medical and lifestyle information. This app aims to support early detection by making predictions through an easy-to-use, interactive interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 🌐
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Machine Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier)
- Data Preprocessing & Column Transformation

## 💡 Key Features
- Beautiful and responsive UI with custom CSS ✨
- User-friendly input forms for medical history and personal information 📝
- Real-time predictions with a trained ML model ⚡️
- Clear and actionable results — with positive and negative detection messages ✅❌
- Age group categorization with color-coded feedback 🎨

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User inputs medical and personal details like age, tumor size, smoking history, etc.
2. Data is preprocessed and transformed using Scikit-learn pipelines.
3. The trained K-Nearest Neighbors model predicts the likelihood of cancer based on input features.
4. Results are displayed in real-time with clear, easy-to-understand feedback.

## 🌱 Why This Matters
Early detection of cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates. By providing a quick and accessible way for users to assess their risk, this app can help raise awareness and encourage timely medical consultations. Leveraging technology for proactive health care is a step toward a healthier future. 💙
